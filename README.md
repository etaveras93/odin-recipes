# odin-recipes
First Project using what the Odin Project has taught me. In this project I will show off the skill I have learned throughout the first few lessons I have read of the Odin Project by creating a basic recipe website that will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. This will included everything I learned so far such as my understanding of elements, tags, boilerplate, list and links.
